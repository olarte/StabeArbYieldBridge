Main Purpose: The main purpose of StableArbYieldBridge is to create a multichain DeFi bridge for stablecoin swaps between Celo and Sui (via Ethereum relay), focusing on arbitrage opportunities from Celo's low liquidity against Sui's high-volume ecosystem, while enabling "earn-while-bridging" through yield-bearing assets. It extends 1Inch's Fusion+ protocol for secure, atomic cross-chain transactions, with added protections and automation for profitable trading.

Core Features:

Bidirectional stablecoin swaps using 1Inch Fusion+ with hashlock/timelock for atomicity.
Arbitrage scanner to detect price discrepancies (e.g., spreads >0.5%) between stables on Celo and Sui.
Chainlink oracle integration for peg protection (pause if deviation >1%).
Bundling with 1Inch Limit Orders for threshold-based execution.
Earn-while-bridging by routing to yield-bearing stables or lending protocols (e.g., USDY on Sui).
One-click trade execution from the UI.
Agent system for setting and auto-executing recurring trades when conditions are met (e.g., every 5 minutes if arb opportunity arises).
Dashboard UI displaying live arb opportunities, simulations, and metrics like estimated profits/yields.
Intended Users: DeFi traders, arbitrageurs, yield farmers, and multichain enthusiasts who want to exploit liquidity differences between chains like Celo and Sui without advanced coding skills.

UI/Design Preferences: Dashboard-style with a financial/trading theme (e.g., dark mode, charts for price spreads, tables listing arb opportunities with columns for asset, spread, profit estimate, and execute buttons). Keep it minimalist and intuitive, like a crypto trading scanner (inspired by tools like DEX Screener), with clear buttons for one-click actions and a section for setting long-term trade agents.

External Integrations:

1Inch Fusion+ SDK and APIs for swaps, quotes, and limit orders.
Chainlink oracles for peg checks (testnet feeds).
Blockchain RPCs: Alchemy or similar for Ethereum/Celo, official Sui RPC for Sui.
Wallet connections: WalletConnect or similar for user authentication (e.g., MetaMask for Celo, Sui Wallet for Sui).
No other external services beyond these blockchain APIs.
